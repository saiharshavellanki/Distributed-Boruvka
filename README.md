# Distributed-Boruvka
Implemented Distributed Boruvka Algorithm in MPI  language using edge partitioning model

For compiling the code use mpicc boruvka.c command and run it using ./a.out

Input :
- The first line contains 2 integers V and E (V = num of vertices ,E = num of edges)
- Followed by E lines where each line is of the form u v w (u = From vertex , v = To vertex , w = weight of the edge from u to v)
